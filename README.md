GreenScore tracks eco-responsibility of spending by analyzing transactions with AI. Each payment gets an eco score (-5 to +5) based on impact (e.g., metro = positive, fuel = negative). Scores combine into a 100-point GreenScore shown on a dashboard with tips and simulated rewards, linking daily spending to sustainability.
